# Reports

## Goal

Create awesome reports!


## Requirements

- [Models, Fields and Relations](../01-models)
- [Computed Fields, Onchange and Constraints](../02-fields)
- [Basic Views](../03-views)


## Problem 1: Citadel (OpenAcademy)

As much as the aerchmaester love the new system, they still love paper and would like to be able to send some invitation to the students with all the valuable information. Apparently their ravens can handle pdf as long as the postal address is on the top right. It would be nice to have a small invitational and personalized text as well as all the information about the session they are about to follow.

### Extra

The younger archmaesters are thinking of adding a barcode scanner at the entrance of the classrooms, add a barcode for the attendee on the invitation.


## Problem 02: Cooperative Planning

Create a report with
- one page showing all the tasks you have to do,
- another page with the same information but ordered by partner.
